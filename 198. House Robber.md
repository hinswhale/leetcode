You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 400

### Solution 1 

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(nums):
        if not nums:
            return 0

        n = len(nums)
        if n == 1:
            return nums[0]
        if n == 2:
            return max(nums[0], nums[1])

        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])

        return dp[n-1]
```

* simper 1:
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0 for i in range(n)]
        for i in range(min(2,n)):
            dp[i] = max(nums[:i+1])

        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i-1])
        return dp[-1]
```

* simper 2:
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l = len(nums)+1
        arr = [0 for i in range(l)]
        for i in range(1, l):
            arr[i] = max(arr[i-1], nums[i-1]+arr[i-2])
        return arr[-1]
```

### Solution 2

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        f = g = 0
        for x in nums:
            f, g = max(f, g), f + x
        return max(f, g)
```



### Solution 3
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        memo = {}

        def search(i, houses):
            if i > len(houses) - 1:
                return 0
            if i in memo:
                return memo[i]
            memo[i] = max(search(i+1, houses), houses[i] + search(i+2, houses))
            return memo[i]
        return search(0, nums)
```
The line of code `memo[i] = max(search(i+1, houses), houses[i] + search(i+2, houses))` is a crucial part of the provided solution for the House Robber problem. Let's break down the meaning of this line of code:

- `memo[i]`: This part of the code is assigning a value to the `memo` dictionary. Specifically, it's assigning a value to the key `i`, which represents the current house index. The purpose of this line is to memoize (store) the maximum amount of money that can be robbed starting from the current house index `i`.

- `max(...)`: The `max` function is used to select the larger value between two options. These two options represent the different choices you have when considering the current house:

  1. `search(i+1, houses)`: This option represents the scenario where you choose not to rob the current house (`houses[i]`) and move on to the next house (`i+1`). `search(i+1, houses)` calculates the maximum amount that can be robbed starting from the next house.

  2. `houses[i] + search(i+2, houses)`: This option represents the scenario where you choose to rob the current house (`houses[i]`) and then move two houses ahead to avoid robbing adjacent houses (`i+2`). This calculates the sum of the value of the current house (`houses[i]`) and the maximum amount that can be robbed starting from two houses ahead (`search(i+2, houses)`).

- `memo[i] = max(...)`: After considering both options, the code assigns the maximum of these two options to `memo[i]`. In other words, it stores in the `memo` dictionary the maximum amount of money that can be robbed starting from the current house index `i`.

The purpose of this line of code is to determine and memoize the optimal choice for each house: whether to rob the current house or skip it. By using memoization, the code avoids recalculating the same subproblem multiple times and ensures that it efficiently computes the maximum amount of money that can be robbed for the entire list of houses.
