You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note:

You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.
 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104
0 <= fee < 5 * 104


### Solution 1:
```python

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        sell = [0] * n
        buy = [0] * n
        buy[0] = -prices[0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            sell[i] = max(sell[i-1], prices[i] + buy[i-1] -fee)
            buy[i] =  max(buy[i-1], sell[i-1] - prices[i])
        return sell[-1]
```


### Solution 2:
```python

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        buy = prices[0] + fee
        for p in prices:
            if p + fee < buy:#若当天买入价格更低，则当天买入更优
                buy = p + fee
            elif p > buy:#能赚则卖
                ans += p - buy 
                buy = p #如果后面能赚更多，则后面再卖，由于p必然比buy大，所以不影响后续买入
        return ans
```
