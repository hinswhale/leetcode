You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104


 ```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit, min_price = 0, float('inf')
        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(min_price, price)
            profit = price - min_price
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        return max_profit
```
时间复杂度是O(n)，其中n是数组 prices 的长度

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(std::vector<int>& prices) {
    if (prices.empty()) {
        return 0;
    };

    int min_price = INT_MAX; // Initialize the minimum price to a very large value
    int max_profit = 0; // Initialize the maximum profit to 0

    for (int price : prices) {
        // Update the minimum price if we find a lower price
        min_price = std::min(min_price, price);

        // Calculate the potential profit if we sell at the current price
        int potential_profit = price - min_price;

        // Update the maximum profit if the potential profit is greater
        max_profit = std::max(max_profit, potential_profit);
    };

    return max_profit;
};

};
```
